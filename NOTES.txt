Internal issues/bugs:

1. Some phones did a preloading of all the classes: e.g. Nokia 3610f tries to load javax.media.location.* and fails:

2. Sometimes, at least on SE W810i the midlet ceased to return from background (still works but blind)
==> HINT: reboot the phone before important logging session! It seems to have helped in my case
